# First Sync

Get your skills synced in 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- macOS, Linux, or Windows
- At least one AI CLI installed (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, etc.)

---

## Step 1: Install skillshare

**Homebrew:**
```bash
brew install skillshare
```

:::note
All install methods include the web dashboard. `skillshare ui` automatically downloads UI assets on first launch — no extra setup needed.
:::

:::tip Updating
To update to the latest version, run `skillshare upgrade`. It auto-detects your install method (Homebrew, manual, etc.) and handles the rest.
:::

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runkids/skillshare/main/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runkids/skillshare/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

---

## Step 2: Initialize

```bash
skillshare init
```

This:
1. Creates your source directory (`~/.config/skillshare/skills/`)
2. Auto-detects installed AI CLIs
3. Sets up configuration
4. Optionally installs the built-in skillshare skill (adds `/skillshare` command to AI CLIs)

:::tip Built-in Skill
During init, you'll be prompted: `Install built-in skillshare skill? [y/N]`. This adds a skill that lets your AI CLI manage skillshare directly. You can skip it and install later with `skillshare upgrade --skill`.
:::

**With git remote (recommended for cross-machine sync):**
```bash
skillshare init --remote git@github.com:you/my-skills.git
```

If the remote already has skills (e.g., from another machine), they'll be pulled automatically during init.

---

## Step 3: Install your first skill

```bash
# Browse available skills
skillshare install anthropics/skills

# Or install directly
skillshare install anthropics/skills/skills/pdf
```

Skills are automatically scanned for security threats during install. If critical issues are found, the install is blocked — use `--force` to override.

---

## Step 4: Sync to all targets

```bash
skillshare sync
```

Your skill is now available in all your AI CLIs.

---

## Verify

```bash
skillshare status
```

You should see:
- Source directory with your skill
- Targets (Claude, Cursor, etc.) showing "synced"

## What Just Happened?

Here's what skillshare did behind the scenes:

1. **`init`** — Created `~/.config/skillshare/config.yaml` and `~/.config/skillshare/skills/`. Auto-detected your AI CLIs (Claude, Cursor, etc.) and added them as targets.

2. **`install`** — Cloned the skill from GitHub into your source directory (`~/.config/skillshare/skills/`). Ran a security audit automatically.

3. **`sync`** — Created symlinks from your source to each target. For example:
   ```
   ~/.claude/skills/pdf → ~/.config/skillshare/skills/pdf  (symlink)
   ```

This means:
- **Edit once, reflect everywhere** — Editing the source file updates all targets instantly (via symlinks)
- **Non-destructive** — Your existing target skills are preserved (merge mode)
- **Reversible** — `skillshare backup` creates snapshots; `skillshare restore` reverts
