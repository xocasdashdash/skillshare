## When to Use

- Something isn't working and you don't know why
- After upgrading skillshare or your OS
- Verify all targets, git, and symlinks are healthy
- First diagnostic step before filing a bug report

## What It Checks

```text
skillshare doctor

Checking environment
  ✓ Config: ~/.config/skillshare/config.yaml
  ✓ Source: ~/.config/skillshare/skills (12 skills)
  ✓ Link support: OK
  ✓ Git: initialized with remote

Checking targets
  ✓ claude    [merge]: merged (8 shared, 2 local)
  ✓ cursor    [copy]: copied (8 managed, 0 local)
  ⚠ codex     [merge]: needs sync

Version
  ✓ CLI: 1.2.0
  ✓ Skill: 1.1.0

Summary
  ✓ All checks passed!
```

## Checks Performed

### Environment

| Check | What It Verifies |
|-------|-----------------|
| Config | Config file exists and is valid |
| Source | Source directory exists and is readable |
| Link support | System can create symlinks |
| Git | Repository status and remote configuration |

### Targets

For each target:
- Path exists and is writable
- Sync mode matches actual state
- Sync drift (linked/managed count vs target expected count after `include`/`exclude`)
- No broken symlinks
- No duplicate skills (symlink mode)
- Valid include/exclude glob patterns

### Version

- CLI version
- Skillshare skill version
- Checks for available updates

### Other

- Skills without `SKILL.md` files
- Last backup timestamp (global mode)
- Trash status (item count, total size, oldest item age)
- Broken symlinks in targets

:::note Project Mode
When a project has `.skillshare/config.yaml`, `skillshare doctor` auto-runs in project mode.

In project mode:
- Config/source checks use `.skillshare/config.yaml` and `.skillshare/skills`
- Trash status uses `.skillshare/trash`
- Backups show `not used in project mode`
:::

## Common Issues

### "Needs sync"

Target mode was changed but not applied:

```bash
skillshare sync
```

### "Not synced"

Target has fewer linked skills than source (e.g. after installing new skills):

```bash
skillshare sync
```

### "Has uncommitted changes"

Tracked repo has local changes:

```bash
cd ~/.config/skillshare/skills/_team-repo
git status
# Commit or discard changes
```

### "Broken symlink"

A skill was removed from source but symlink remains:

```bash
skillshare sync  # Will prune orphaned symlinks
```

### "Skills without SKILL.md"

Skill folders missing required file:

```bash
# Add SKILL.md to each skill, or remove the folder
skillshare new my-skill  # Creates proper structure
```

### "Link not supported"

On Windows without Developer Mode:

1. Enable Developer Mode in Settings
2. Or run as Administrator
