# status

Show the current state of skillshare: source, tracked repositories, targets, and versions.

```bash
skillshare status
```

## When to Use

- Check if all targets are in sync after making changes
- See which targets need a `sync` run
- Verify tracked repos are up to date
- Check for CLI or skill updates

## Sections

### Source

Shows the source directory location, skill count, and last modified time.

### Tracked Repositories

Lists git repositories installed with `--track`. Shows:
- Skill count per repository
- Git status (up-to-date or has changes)

### Targets

Shows each configured target with:
- **Sync mode**: `merge`, `copy`, or `symlink`
- **Path**: Target directory location
- **Status**: `merged`, `linked`, `unlinked`, or `needs sync`
- **Shared/local counts**: In merge and copy modes, counts use that target's expected set (after `include`/`exclude` filters). Copy mode shows "managed" instead of "shared".

If a target is in symlink mode, `include`/`exclude` is ignored.

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `merged` | Skills are symlinked individually |
| `copied` | Skills are copied as real files (with manifest) |
| `linked` | Entire directory is symlinked |
| `unlinked` | Not yet synced |
| `needs sync` | Mode changed, run `sync` to apply |
| `not synced` | Some expected skills (after filters) are missing — run `sync` |

### Version

Compares your CLI and skill versions against the latest releases.

## Project Mode

In a project directory, status shows project-specific information:

```bash
skillshare status        # Auto-detected if .skillshare/ exists
skillshare status -p     # Explicit project mode
```

### Example Output

```
Project Skills (.skillshare/)

Source
  ✓ .skillshare/skills (3 skills)

Targets
  ✓ claude       [merge] .claude/skills (3 synced)
  ✓ cursor       [merge] .cursor/skills (3 synced)

Remote Skills
  ✓ pdf          anthropic/skills/pdf
  ✓ review       github.com/team/tools
```

Project status does not show Tracked Repositories or Version sections (these are global-only features).
