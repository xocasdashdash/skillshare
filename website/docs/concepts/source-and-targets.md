# Source & Targets

The core model behind skillshare: one source, many targets.

## The Problem

Without skillshare, you manage skills separately for each AI CLI:

```
~/.claude/skills/         # Edit here
  └── my-skill/

~/.cursor/skills/         # Copy to here
  └── my-skill/           # Now out of sync!

~/.codex/skills/          # And here
  └── my-skill/           # Also out of sync!
```

**Pain points:**
- Edits in one place don't propagate
- Skills drift apart over time
- No single source of truth

---

## The Solution

Skillshare introduces a **source directory** that syncs to all **targets**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         SOURCE (edit here)              │
│   ~/.config/skillshare/skills/          │
│                                         │
│   my-skill/   another/   _team-repo/    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    │
                    │ skillshare sync
                    ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              TARGETS                    │
│   ~/.claude/skills/  (symlinks)         │
│   ~/.cursor/skills/  (symlinks)         │
│   ~/.codex/skills/   (symlinks)         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Benefits:**
- Edit in source → all targets update instantly
- Edit in target → changes go to source (via symlinks)
- Single source of truth

---

## Why Sync is a Separate Step

Operations like `install`, `update`, and `uninstall` only modify the **source** directory. A separate `sync` step propagates changes to all targets. This two-phase design is intentional:

**Preview before propagating** — Run `sync --dry-run` to review what will change across all targets before applying. Especially useful after `uninstall` or `--force` operations.

**Batch multiple changes** — Install 5 skills, then sync once. Without separation, each install would trigger a full scan and symlink update across all targets.

**Safe by default** — Source changes are staged, not immediately live. You stay in control of when targets update. Additionally, `uninstall` moves skills to a trash directory (kept 7 days) instead of permanently deleting them, so accidental removals are recoverable.

:::tip Exception: pull
`pull` automatically runs sync after `git pull`. Since its intent is "bring everything up to date from remote," auto-syncing matches the expected behavior.
:::

:::info When sync is NOT needed
Editing an existing skill doesn't require sync — symlinks mean changes are instantly visible in all targets. You only need sync when the set of skills changes (add, remove, rename) or when targets/modes change.

## Source Directory

**Default location:** `~/.config/skillshare/skills/`

This is where:
- You create and edit skills
- Skills are installed to
- Git tracks changes (for cross-machine sync)

**Structure:**
```
~/.config/skillshare/skills/
├── my-skill/
│   └── SKILL.md
├── code-review/
│   └── SKILL.md
├── _team-skills/          # Tracked repo (underscore prefix)
│   ├── frontend/
│   │   └── ui/
│   └── backend/
│       └── api/
└── ...
```

### Organize with Folders (Auto-Flattening)

You can use folders to organize your own skills — they'll be auto-flattened when synced to targets:

```
SOURCE (organized)                  TARGET (flattened)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
~/.config/skillshare/skills/        ~/.claude/skills/
├── work/                           ├── work__api-design/
│   ├── api-design/        ───►     ├── work__code-review/
│   └── code-review/       ───►     ├── personal__blog-helper/
├── personal/                       └── personal__recipe/
│   ├── blog-helper/       ───►
│   └── recipe/            ───►
```

**Benefits:**
- Organize skills by project, team, or category
- No manual flattening required
- AI CLIs get the flat structure they expect
- Folder names become prefixes for traceability

## Targets

Targets are AI CLI skill directories that skillshare syncs to.

**Common targets:**
- `~/.claude/skills/` — Claude Code
- `~/.cursor/skills/` — Cursor
- `~/.codex/skills/` — OpenAI Codex CLI
- `~/.gemini/skills/` — Gemini CLI
- And [45+ more](/docs/targets/supported-targets)

**Auto-detection:** When you run `skillshare init`, it automatically detects installed AI CLIs and adds them as targets.

**Manual addition:**
```bash
skillshare target add myapp ~/.myapp/skills
```

## How Sync Works

### Source → Targets (`sync`)

```bash
skillshare sync
```

Creates symlinks from each target to the source:
```
~/.claude/skills/my-skill → ~/.config/skillshare/skills/my-skill
```

### Target → Source (`collect`)

```bash
skillshare collect claude
```

Collects local skills from a target back to source:
1. Finds non-symlinked skills in target
2. Copies them to source
3. Replaces with symlinks

---

## Editing Skills

Because targets are symlinked to source, you can edit from anywhere:

**Edit in source:**
```bash
$EDITOR ~/.config/skillshare/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
# Changes visible in all targets immediately
```

**Edit in target:**
```bash
$EDITOR ~/.claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
# Changes go to source (same file via symlink)
```
