# Changelog

## [0.9.0] - 2026-02-05

### Added
- **Project-level skills** — scope skills to a single repository, shared via git
  - `skillshare init -p` to initialize project mode
  - `.skillshare/` directory with `config.yaml`, `skills/`, and `.gitignore`
  - All core commands support `-p` flag: `sync`, `install`, `uninstall`, `update`, `list`, `status`, `target`, `collect`
- **Auto-detection** — commands automatically switch to project mode when `.skillshare/config.yaml` exists
- **Per-target sync mode for project mode** — each target can use `merge` or `symlink` independently
- **`--discover` flag** — detect and add new AI CLI targets to existing project config
- **Tracked repos in project mode** — `install --track -p` clones repos into `.skillshare/skills/`
- Integration tests for all project mode commands

### Changed
- Terminology: "Team Sharing" → "Organization-Wide Skills", "Team Edition" → "Organization Skills"
- Documentation restructured with dual-level architecture (Organization + Project)
- Unified project sync output format with global sync

## [0.8.0] - 2026-01-31

### Breaking Changes

**Command Rename: `pull <target>` → `collect <target>`**

For clearer command symmetry, `pull` is now exclusively for git operations:

| Before | After | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `pull claude` | `collect claude` | Collect skills from target to source |
| `pull --all` | `collect --all` | Collect from all targets |
| `pull --remote` | `pull` | Pull from git remote |

### New Command Symmetry

| Operation | Commands | Direction |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Local sync | `sync` / `collect` | Source ↔ Targets |
| Remote sync | `push` / `pull` | Source ↔ Git Remote |

```
Remote (git)
   ↑ push    ↓ pull
Source
   ↓ sync    ↑ collect
Targets
```

### Migration

```bash
# Before
skillshare pull claude
skillshare pull --remote

# After
skillshare collect claude
skillshare pull
```
